The Tao Framework for .NET is a collection of bindings to facilitate
cross-platform game-related development utilizing the .NET platform.

Currently included bindings are OpenGL 1.5, GLU 1.3, GLUT 3.7.6, WGL,
various GL and WGL-related extensions, OpenAL 1.0, Cg 1.2.1, DevIL 1.6.6,
SDL 1.2.8, and GLFW 2.4.2.

These bindings all function in a cross-platform and cross-runtime manner
using Microsoft's .NET 1.0 and 1.1 runtimes on Windows and the Mono runtime
on Windows and Linux.  Other platforms and runtimes have not been tested,
but, would most likely work with a minimal amount of changes.

The bindings are also CLS-compliant, meaning that they can be used by any
.NET language, including C# and Visual Basic .NET, amongst others.

The Tao Framework bindings and example applications are free for commercial
and non-commercial usage and all source code is provided under the very
liberal MIT-X11 license.  However, any source code and documentation changes,
corrections, improvements, and additions are requested for the good of all
Tao Framework users.
