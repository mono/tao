Issues
------

Single/Double precision:
	Currently the code is configured for single precision, so can only be 
	run against a single precision Ode library.
	Tao.Ode binding can be configured for double precision by changing the 
	value of the dReal alias to System.Double and recompiling, but this 
	hasn't been tested extensively.
	What needs to be worked out is a reasonable way to deal with the fact 
	that there can be at least 2 versions of the ODE library.  
	Possible solutions:
	-	Compile 2 versions of Tao.Ode (Tao.Ode.Single.dll and 
		Tao.Ode.Double.dll) as part of normal build
	-	Target a single assembly (Tao.Ode.dll) but control precision 
		at compile time with appropriate #ifdef statements.
	-	Your solution here - let me know on the Tao mailing list
   
Trimesh collision functions:

TriMeshData:
	The trimesh functions take a pointer to mesh data and store the 
	pointer internally, they dont copy the memory. 
	This was one of the crash problems i guess. 
  	Right now my workaround is to pin the memory (at least this is what 
	i intended, look at the OdeTriMeshData class).
	TLT NOTE: Not in Tao Subversion repository.

OdeGeom.Collide:
	crashes sometimes when trimeshes are used, dont know why...
	even when it works there is a chance that trimeshes intersect 
	with each other.
