Hey folks,

Please propose standards here.

Proposition: Patches should be submitted in either Unified or Context
diff format.  These diffs can be generated and consumed by many tools.
On unix-like operating systems, a unified diff of two directories
(presumably, the changed directory and the head of svn) can be created
thus:


$ ls
buildDiff.sh  tao.autotools  tao-buildchange  tao-head
tao_2_0       tao.build      tao-cjcollier

$ diff -x ".svn" -aruN tao-head tao-cjcollier > cjcollier.patch
