Issues
------

Single/Double precision:
	Currently the code is configured for single precision, so can only be 
	run against a single precision Ode library.
	Tao.Ode binding can be configured for double precision by changing the 
	value of the dReal alias to System.Double and recompiling, but this 
	hasn't been tested extensively.
	What needs to be worked out is a reasonable way to deal with the fact 
	that there can be at least 2 versions of the ODE library.  
	Possible solutions:
	-	Compile 2 versions of Tao.Ode (Tao.Ode.Single.dll and 
		Tao.Ode.Double.dll) as part of normal build
	-	Target a single assembly (Tao.Ode.dll) but control precision 
		at compile time with appropriate #ifdef statements.
	-	Your solution here - let me know on the Tao mailing list
   

Unit tests:
	Unit tests need to be written to cover as much ODE functionality as possible.
	Tests for Matrix3 marshalling have already been implemented.
