	/// <summary>
	/// <p>SdlMixer is a simple multi-channel audio mixer. 
	/// It supports 8 channels of 16 bit stereo audio, plus a 
	/// single channel of music, mixed by the popular MikMod MOD, 
	/// Timidity MIDI and SMPEG MP3 libraries.</p> 
	/// <p>
	/// The mixer can currently load Microsoft WAVE files and 
	/// Creative Labs VOC files as audio samples, and can load MIDI 
	/// files via Timidity and the following music formats via 
	/// MikMod: .MOD .S3M .IT .XM. It can load Ogg Vorbis streams 
	/// as music if built with the Ogg Vorbis libraries, and 
	/// finally it can load MP3 music using the SMPEG library.</p> 
	/// <p>
	/// The process of mixing MIDI files to wave output is very CPU 
	/// intensive, so if playing regular WAVE files sound great, but
	///  playing MIDI files sound choppy, try using 8-bit audio, 
	///  mono audio, or lower frequencies.</p>
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// This assumes you have gotten SDL_mixer and installed it 
	/// on your system. SDL_mixer has an INSTALL document in the
	///  source distribution to help you get it compiled and installed. 
	///	SDL_mixer supports playing music and sound samples from 
	///	the following formats:
	///	<code>
	///	- WAVE/RIFF (.wav)
	///	- AIFF (.aiff)
	///	- VOC (.voc)
	///	- MOD (.mod .xm .s3m .669 .it .med and more) using included mikmod
	///	- MIDI (.mid) using timidity or native midi hardware
	///	- OggVorbis (.ogg) requiring ogg/vorbis libraries on system
	///	- MP3 (.mp3) requiring SMPEG library on system
	///	- also any command-line player, which is not mixed by SDL_mixer...
	///	</code>
	///	<p>
	///	When using SDL_mixer functions you need to avoid the 
	///	following functions from SDL:</p>
	/// <p><code>
	///	SDL_OpenAudio 
	///	Use Mix_OpenAudio instead. 
	///	SDL_CloseAudio 
	///	Use Mix_CloseAudio instead. 
	///	SDL_PauseAudio 
	///	Use Mix_Pause(-1) and Mix_PauseMusic instead, to pause.
	///	Use Mix_Resume(-1) and Mix_ResumeMusic instead, to unpause. 
	///	SDL_LockAudio 
	///	This is just not needed since SDL_mixer handles this for you.
	///	Using it may cause problems as well. 
	///	SDL_UnlockAudio 
	///	This is just not needed since SDL_mixer handles this for you.
	///	Using it may cause problems as well. </code></p>
	///	<p>You may call the following functions freely:</p> 
	/// <code>
	///	SDL_AudioDriverName 
	///	This will still work as usual. 
	///	SDL_GetAudioStatus 
	///	This will still work, though it will likely return 
	///	SDL_AUDIO_PLAYING even though SDL_mixer is just playing silence. 
	///	It is also a BAD idea to call SDL_mixer and SDL audio 
	///	functions from a callback. Callbacks include Effects 
	///	functions and other SDL_mixer audio hooks. </code>
