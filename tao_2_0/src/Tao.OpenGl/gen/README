This file holds the tools used to generate Tao's Gl.cs OpenGL
bindings.  The .spec files come from the SGI OpenGL sample
implementation, hosted at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/.

There will eventually be tools here to do some XSLT/XPath-y goodness
on the resulting XML files, which the binding generator can use to
annotate the resulting .cs file with docs and other bits; however,
that's not really necessary to get a first functional release.

Right now, generation requires an installed python and a
C# compiler/runtime.  The simplistic Makefile is set up for generating
on linux, though it should work on windows with only minor
modifications.
