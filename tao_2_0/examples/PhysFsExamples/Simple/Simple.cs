			 * to do this.

			 * From the docs:
			 * argv0 the argv[0] string passed to your program's mainline. This may be NULL 
			 * on most platforms (such as ones without a standard main() function), but you 
			 * should always try to pass something in here. Unix-like systems such as Linux 
			 * _need_ to pass argv[0] from main() in here.

			 * After you have it initialized, then you need to set up any archives that 
			 * will be read from.  You can do this by using the

			 * end of the search path so that it is the last looked at.  You could instead 
			 * put a 0 there and have it be the first thing looked at.

			 * frees memory, and invalidates all of your file handles.
