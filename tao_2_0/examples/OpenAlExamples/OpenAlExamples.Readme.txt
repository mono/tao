These are C# ports of various OpenAL examples, most of which can be
found at http://www.devmaster.net/articles.php?catID=6.  They make use of
OpenAL and some use FreeGLUT, make sure to have the appropriate native
libraries for your system installed.

These examples aren't well documented, but they should be fairly easy
to understand, particularly if you follow along with the originals,
however, do not take them to be 'best practices' for .NET OpenAL and
OpenGL development.  The intent of these ports is as an introduction or
as a comparison against the original native versions.

If you'd like to contribute you may want to try porting further OpenAL
examples from http://www.devmaster.net/articles.php?catID=6 particularly
lesson 08 and you might like to try porting the examples from the native
OpenAL distribution.
