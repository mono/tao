These are C# ports of some OpenGL examples developed by Ge Wang, the originals
are available from http://www.gewang.com/projects/samples/opengl/.

These examples use Tao.OpenGl and Tao.FreeGlut.  Make sure you have the
appropriate native libraries for your system installed.

These examples are fairly well documented, however, do not take
them to be 'best practices' for .NET OpenGL development.  The
intent of these ports is as an introduction or as a comparison
against the original native versions.

If you'd like to contribute you can port the Globe example as listed
on Ge Wang's site.  I never got around to it, but it looks pretty
trivial.
