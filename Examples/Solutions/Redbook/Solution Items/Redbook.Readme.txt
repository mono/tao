These are C# ports of examples found at
http://www.opengl.org/developers/code/examples/redbook/.  They make
use of FreeGLUT, make sure to have the appropriate native libraries
for your system installed.

These examples are somewhat well documented, however, do not take
them to be 'best practices' for .NET OpenGL development.  The
intent of these ports is as an introduction or as a comparison
against the original native versions.
