These are C# ports of some OpenGL examples developed by Nate Robins,
the originals are available from http://www.xmission.com/~nate/sgi.html.

These examples use Tao.OpenGl and Tao.FreeGlut.  Make sure you have the
appropriate native libraries for your system installed.

These examples are fairly well documented, however, do not take
them to be 'best practices' for .NET OpenGL development.  The
intent of these ports is as an introduction or as a comparison
against the original native versions.
