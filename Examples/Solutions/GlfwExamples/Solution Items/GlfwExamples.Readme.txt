GlfwExamples

These are C# ports of some OpenGL examples developed for GLFW, the originals
are available from http://glfw.sourceforge.net.

These examples use Tao.OpenGl and Tao.Glfw.  Make sure you have the
appropriate native GLFW libraries for your system installed.

These examples are fairly well documented, however, do not take
them to be 'best practices' for .NET OpenGL development.  The
intent of these ports is as an introduction or as a comparison
against the original native versions.

If you'd like to contribute you can port the remaining examples as supplied
with GLFW.  I never got around to them, but they look pretty trivial.
